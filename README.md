# ISBN LibGen Search - Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension allows users to easily search for a book's ISBN on LibGen directly from an Amazon book listing page. The extension identifies the ISBN-13 number from the Amazon listing and opens the corresponding search results on libgen.is in a new tab.

## Installation

To install this Chrome extension locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file and extract it to a folder on your computer.
2. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top-right corner of the extensions page.
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the folder containing the extracted extension files.
5. The "ISBN LibGen Search" extension should now appear in your list of installed extensions, and the extension icon should be visible in the Chrome toolbar.

## Usage

1. Visit an Amazon book listing page.
2. Click the "ISBN LibGen Search" extension icon in the Chrome toolbar to open the popup.
3. Click the "Search LibGen" button.
4. If the ISBN is found on the Amazon page, a new tab will open with the libgen.is search results for that ISBN. If the ISBN is not found, an alert will be displayed.
